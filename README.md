# LogisticRegression_ChurnAnalysis
The goal of this project was to build an accurate model that could help predict a customer's likelihood to churn.

Similar to the linear regression model, we are using the same telecommunications data set provided by Western Governors University. I took a similar approach when it came to feature selection, using a backwards stepwise reduction until all of the remaining variables were considered to be statistically significant.

The model was evaluated in a couple different ways: AUC scores of each variable, AUC scores of the model as a whole, and an accuracy score and confusion matrix that used our training and test data to make predictions.
